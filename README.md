# Learn OpenCV

## Overview  
This project is designed to help you learn **image processing** and **computer vision** using **OpenCV**. It covers a wide range of topics from basic image manipulation to deep learning with OpenCV, providing both theoretical explanations and hands-on coding examples. The goal is to build a comprehensive understanding of OpenCV and its applications in real-world scenarios.

## Features  
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Topics range from basic image processing to deep learning with OpenCV.  
- **Practical Examples:** Includes Jupyter notebooks with practical examples for each topic.  
- **Hands-on Learning:** The project is designed for learners to experiment with code and images directly.
